## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ahmet, and I've been passionate about technology, literature, and cinema since childhood. My software journey began in middle school with simple Scratch projects, eventually leading me to explore the broader world of technology. In 2022, I earned a scholarship in the Information Systems and Technologies (CTIS) department at Bilkent University, one of Turkey's top institutions. There, I enhanced my English proficiency, deepened my technical expertise, and expanded my network through various university clubs. Beyond my major, I pursued courses in Japanese and Economics while earning certifications in multiple fieldsâ€”primarily artificial intelligenceâ€”from prestigious institutions such as Google and IBM. In 2024, I qualified for the Aspire Leaders Program, founded at Harvard by Harvard Business School professors in 2017. In my free time, I divide my focus between two passions. I dedicate part of it to reading books and sharing literature through my social media accounts, and the other half to developing software and AI projects.
